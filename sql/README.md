## Description
SQL is a common language used in data science jobs, designed to manage data held in a relational database management system. This workshop will aim to detail the uses of SQL in industry, and give a brief introduction in how to use it. 

## Prerequisites
This workshop demands that users:
1. Have either [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) available on your computer
2. Have the example dataset downloaded
3. Have a general knowledge of data structures in languages like Python and R

    
## Workshop objectives:
1. Have a basic understanding of SQL and what it is used for
2. Be able to set up SQL in other porgrams suchs as RStudio and Jupyter Notebokks
3. Become familiar with some basic SQL functions

## Workshop materials:
- [Notebook Viewer]

## What We Won't Cover:
We won't be covering more advanced functions of SQL. This is meant to be an introduction to SQL in more familiar platforms like RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks. If you need a tutorial on how to use Jupyter Notebooks, please see [this](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021/tree/main/jupyter-notebook) previous workshop by Kim Nguyen.

## Description
Functions and iteration are vital components of the coding language R, enabling efficient and flexible programming. Functions allow for the encapsulation and reuse of code blocks, enhancing code organization and modularity. By defining functions, programmers can break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units, promoting code readability and maintainability. Iteration, on the other hand, empowers developers to repeat operations or calculations over a range of values or elements. This iterative capability is particularly valuable when working with large datasets or performing repetitive tasks, as it eliminates the need for redundant code and simplifies complex operations. Together, functions and iteration provide R programmers with powerful tools to streamline their code, enhance productivity, and solve a wide range of data-related problems efficiently. In this workshop, we will cover the basics of functions and iterations for better, cleaner coding in R!  

## Prerequisites
This workshop demands that users:
1. have the R programming language downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/)
2. have the R Studio user interface downloaded, which can be accessed here:(https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. have the packages listed below installed
4. have a proficiency with the R programming language


## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Download the R Markdown script from github
3. Download the relevant packages (See below)
    
## Workshop objectives:
-   Learn when to use functions, and how to make custom functions
-   Function style and housekeeping
-   When to use iteration, loops and their alternatives
-   Apply knowledge of functions and iteration to load all files from a folder of data and perform quality assurance measures

## What We Won't Cover:
We will not be covering data wrangling, or how to format the data to in way that facilitates visualization. We also will not be covering how to conduct statistical tests of the data that we will be utilizing.

### Packages
```tidyverse``` - [a collection of packages that are always incredibly helpful no matter what project you're working on; sometimes the only package I load (contains ggplot2](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)

```vembedr``` - [Used to embed video urls within the script](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vembedr/vignettes/vembedr.html)

```gapminder``` - [used for some data analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html)

```glue``` - [package contained within tidyverse that helps interpret strings as literals - also very helpful for data analysis of text!](https://glue.tidyverse.org/)

```datasets``` - [package where public data is stored](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)

# COG Summer Workshops 2023

The Coding Outreach Group (COG) weekly summer workshops focus on a specific research skill or topic and aim to have participants actively involved. These workshops try to be as hands-on as possible and for attendees to get the most out of the workshops, they should ideally already have some basic coding experience (i.e., be able to run an analysis in at least one coding language). Some topics may look familiar from previous years ([2022](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2022), [2021](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2021) and [2020](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/cog_summer_workshops_2020)), however, we have recruited new presenters for these repeated topics, who will provide their unique point of view and methodology. People new to coding are welcome to attend but may not receive the adequate help needed to follow along with the content. If you would like to learn some basic coding, we have a [list of tutorials](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/Tutorials/blob/master/index.md) for various programming languages.

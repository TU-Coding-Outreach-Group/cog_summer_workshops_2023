## Description
This workshop will cover how to use [jsPsych version 7.3.3](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases/tag/jspsych%407.3.3) to build psychological experiments. jsPsych is a free, open-source software that employs a JavaScript framework for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser. It's a popular alternative to PsychoPy and E-Prime for task development, is used primarily in behavioral tasks, and supports online study capabilities.  

## Set Up (do before the workshop)
1. Download Visual Studio Code, which is a programming-friendly text editor that works with Windows, OSX/Mac, and Linux, and can be downloaded at the following link:  https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

2. Download the latest release of jsPsych, which as of now is jsPsych 7.3.3. The jsPsych software is a set of files located in the Dist Archive zipped folder at the following link (https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases/tag/jspsych%407.3.3).

3. Download the 'jsPsych_workshop' folder from the TU COG Github. This is the folder containing the 'stimuli' folder, which has images that we will use as part of the experimental task. We will be working in this "jsPsych_workshop" folder for the purposes of this workshop and we will be saving our experimental task file to this folder.
